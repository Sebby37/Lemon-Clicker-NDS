# Lemon-Clicker-NDS
A port of lemon clicker for the DS using libnds and NightFox Lib

# The Game
Tap the lemon on the touchscreen to increase your score, or press 'a' to tap for you
When you have 100 points (or more) you can press 'x' or tap the button to buy an autoclicker

# TODO
- Implement a **working** saving and loading system
- Add the timer thing so after 60 seconds, the player can choose to either double their points for 20s or to get 200 points instantly
- Use the rest of the ds buttons to be able to click the virtual buttons
- Give the top screen a better use
###### (Guess who will probably never finish this todo list!

# Compiling
Make sure you have devkitpro installed with libnds, then just run build.bat or run make through msys2
